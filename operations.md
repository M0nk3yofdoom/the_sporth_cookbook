Stack operations manipulate the stack in Sporth. At the moment, Sporth has
a very small set of stack operations. 

In order of usefulness, they are as follows:

**dup**: duplicates the item on the stack ( a dup -> a a)

**swap**: swaps the last two items on the stack ( a b swap -> b a )

**rot**: rotates the third-to-last item on the stack: ( a b c rot -> b c a )
