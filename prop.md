Prop is one of the microlanguaged embedded inside of Sporth. It is a 
rhythmic notation system based on proportions. 

Prop can be used to create very complex drum machines and rhythmic profiles. 

In Sporth, there are two ugens for prop. **prop** is the original ugen that compiles
a prop string and a BPM, and creates a set of [ticks](gates_triggers.html). 
The ugen called **tprop** is identical to prop, except that it has a trigger 
argument that resets prop to the beginning.
